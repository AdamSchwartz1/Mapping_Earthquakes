# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a multi-layer map to show earthquake information over the last 7 days.

### Applications
D3, Javascript, Leaflet, HTML, CSS, Mapbox API, and github branches.

## Analysis
I created a map that has 3 different data sets and 3 map styles to choose from.
- The first data set mapped all earthquakes over the last 7 days. I changed the style of the markers to circle markers so that the marker's color and size are based on the magnitude of the earthquake. There is also a popup that tells the exact magnitude and where it happened. The legend on the map pertains to this first data set.
- The second data set maps all of the tectonic plate lines. I changed the style of these lines so the weight was a little bolder and the color is red so that it stands out on the map.
- The third data set is very similar to the first, except that it plots only major earthquakes. There are only three tiers marked on this layer: magnitudes greater than 6 are red, greater than 5 are orange, and greater than 4.5 are yellow.
